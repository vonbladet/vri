VRI (the Virtual Radio Interferometer) is a Java applet that simulates
how radio interferometers work. If you are not familiar with this
field, then we suggest that you browse the <A HREF="guide.html">VRI
Guide</A>, which describes the concepts and basic operation of this
aspect of astronomical study.
<P>
The applet simulates how the placement of the antennas affects the
<EM>uv-coverage</EM> of a given array and illustrates the fourier
transform relation ship between the accumulated radio visibilities and
the resultant image.
<P>
This applet is focussed on four "panels" which represent (clockwise
from top right), the placement of the antennas on the ground, the
uv-coverage that would result from that placement, the fourier
transform of the image (which may be masked by the uv-coverage) and
the image itself (either initial or measured). Various widgets around
the outside of these panels allow the control of various parameters.
